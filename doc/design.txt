Block/Ban Offending IP Addresses:

Also, always make sure SSH_CLIENT isn't blocked, if it's present

Usage:

boia <options> :

-h, -v (version), -d (daemon), -c <config_file> (default /etc/boia.conf)
-a (act; find and add bad IPs in non daemon mode and then exit)
-t (dry run; only detects and reports bad IPs)
-p (parses the config file)
-l (lists bad IPs in its "DB")
-g (garbage collection; expires old IPs from the "DB")
-r (reload; signals the daemon to reread the config file if it's all good)
-z (delete/zap; removes/unlbocks all the bad IPs it has found)
