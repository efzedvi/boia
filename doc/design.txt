Block/Ban Offending IP Addresses:

Make use of : Linux::Inotify2 and IO::KQueue
https://wiki.netbsd.org/tutorials/kqueue_tutorial/

Also, always make sure SSH_CLIENT isn't blocked, if it's present

Usage:

boia <options> :

-h, -v (version), -d (daemon), -c <config_file> (default /etc/boia.conf)
-a (act; find and add bad IPs in non daemon mode and then exit)
-t (dry run; only detects and reports bad IPs)
-p (parses the config file)
-r (reload; signals the daemon to reread the config file if it's all good)
-z (delete/zap; removes/unlbocks all the bad IPs it has found)
-n (do not run zapcmd in the begining of a run)

Config file:


[global]
#jail = /var/lib/boia/badips.json   # not sure about this one yet

blockcmd = <optional>  (passes: %ip, %date, %app_name=boia)
unblockcmd = <optional>
