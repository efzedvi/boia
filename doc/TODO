- module POD docs
- man pages for boia and boia.conf
- Make the Makefile install boia.conf and boia.conf man pages
- Test that daemon will exit if config file is updated with an error and reloaded
- Test that daemon properly loads the jail file
- Test the case where ip parameter doesn't define an IP properly for any reasons
- Make process() add to release_time of the jailed IP if we see it on other logfiles (make it optional)
